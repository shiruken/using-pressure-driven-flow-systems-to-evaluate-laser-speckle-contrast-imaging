# Improved fluid phantom for accurate relative flow calculations for speckle contrast imaging

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for my paper comparing syringe pump and pressure-regulated microfluidic flow systems and their impact on multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI) measurements. This work was conducted during my postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin in the [Functional Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/) ([@UTFOIL](https://github.com/utfoil)).
