# Using pressure-driven flow systems to evaluate laser speckle contrast imaging

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for my paper comparing syringe pump and pressure-regulated microfluidic flow systems and their impact on assessing multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI) flow measurements. This work was conducted during my postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin in the [Functional Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/) ([@UTFOIL](https://github.com/utfoil)).
