A close correlation of relative blood velocity, inlet flow rate and blood viscosity were found using this microfluidic-based LSCI system. In addition, our platform also allows the demonstration of spatiotemporal variation of blood flow in response to magnet-induced magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) retention. The flow behaviour of erythrocytes with the presence of MNPs appeared to be closely correlated with the location of the magnet placement. Our microfluidic-based LSCI measurement represents a simple yet controllable experimental model for evaluating the variations in different hemorheological conditions in vitro and has a strong potential as an easy-to-use tool for investigating local MNP retention and hemodynamic changes.}},

We now describe experiments in the rat retina in which LSF was used in conjunction with confocal microscopy to monitor light-evoked changes in blood flow in retinal vessels. This dual imaging technique permitted us to stimulate retinal photoreceptors and measure vessel diameter with confocal microscopy while simultaneously monitoring blood flow with LSF. We found that a flickering light dilated retinal arterioles and evoked increases in retinal blood velocity with similar time courses. In addition, focal light stimulation evoked local increases in blood velocity. The spatial distribution of these increases depended on the location of the stimulus relative to retinal arterioles and venules. The results suggest that capillaries are largely unresponsive to local neuronal activity and that hemodynamic responses are mediated primarily by arterioles. The use of LSF to image retinal blood flow holds promise in elucidating the mechanisms mediating functional hyperemia in the retina and in characterizing changes in blood flow that occur during retinal pathology.}},

In this work, we develop the first-of-its-kind dual-display laparoscopic vision system integrating LSCI with a commercially available 10mm rigid laparoscope where the laser has the same optical axis as the laparoscope. Designed for MIS, our system permits standard color RGB, label-free vasculature imaging, and fused display modes. A graphics processing unit accelerated algorithm enables the real-time display of three different modes at the surgical site. We demonstrate the capability of our system for imaging relative flow rates in a microfluidic phantom with channels as small as 200 \&\#x003BC;m at a working distance of 1\&\#x02013;5 cm from the laparoscope tip to the phantom surface. Using our system, we reveal early changes in bowel perfusion, which are invisible to standard color vision using a rat bowel occlusion model.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐labeled RBCs flowing in the microvasculature of the cerebral cortex of urethane‐anesthetized Wistar rats were recorded through the skull window on video clips during specified periods at high frame rates (500 fps). Sequential frames of moving RBCs in the video clips for a specified period were analyzed offline with in‐house software (KEIO‐IS2). Images of RBCs acquired were numbered automatically in order of appearance and displayed in a two‐dimensional (2‐D) RBC tracking map. The velocities of individual RBCs were automatically computed based on the RBC displacement per frame multiplied by the frame rate (fps), and the results were displayed in a 2‐D velocity map and a 2‐D RBC number map. Single capillaries were identified by staining with FITC‐dextran. The mean capillary velocity of RBCs was evaluated as 2.05 ± 1.59 mm/second in video clips obtained at 500 fps.

The authors report on their first clinical experience with laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) as a complementary imaging tool for the noninvasive and dynamic assessment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neurovascular surgery. The purpose of this preliminary study was to address the general feasibility of LASCA in terms of handling and image quality and to provide an example of its clinical implications. 
METHODS:Laser speckle contrast analysis was performed in patients undergoing cerebral revascularization procedures for the treatment of hemodynamic compromise and complex aneurysms. The portable LASCA device was centered over the surgical field, and continuous 5-minute recordings of relative CBF were obtained. In the case of flow augmentation for hemodynamic compromise, CBF monitoring was performed before and after completion of the anastomosis. In the case of flow replacement for parent artery sacrifice, CBF monitoring was performed during consecutive 30-second test occlusions of the radial artery graft after proximal internal carotid artery sacrifice and the subsequent initiation of blood flow through the bypass.

RESULTS:In all cases, the authors achieved good visualization of relative CBF in addition to flow imaging in both the bypass graft and the cortical vasculature. During a sudden CBF decrease after test occlusion of the radial artery graft and subsequent flow initiation through the bypass, LASCA allowed immediate visualization and measurement of relative CBF in excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

CONCLUSIONS:In this study LASCA offered noninvasive and rapid intraoperative assessment of relative CBF, which can be used for optimizing neurovascular procedures.}},

Cortical spreading depression caused long-lasting blood-flow enhancement selectively within the middle meningeal artery dependent upon trigeminal and parasympathetic activation, and plasma protein leakage within the dura mater in part by a neurokinin-1-receptor mechanism.

title = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging for intraoperative monitoring of cerebral blood flow}}, 
author = {Richards, Lisa M.}, 
abstract = {{Ensuring adequate blood flow during surgical procedures is crucial, as prolonged ischemia can result in tissue death and lead to poor clinical outcomes. This is especially important during neurosurgery, since the brain relies on a constant supply of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to maintain normal function. Intraoperative blood flow monitoring tools are essential to detect ischemia in a timely manner, and allow surgical correction before the onset of irreversible brain injury. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical imaging method that provides blood flow maps with high spatiotemporal resolution, and overcomes many of the limitations of current intraoperative monitoring technologies. The objective of this dissertation is to demonstrate that LSCI is an effective tool for blood flow monitoring during neurosurgery, and to optimize and improve LSCI technology for clinical use. This research has two primary elements: assessing the LSCI instrumentation components in a controlled laboratory setting, and evaluating the clinical performance of LSCI during neurosurgery. The laboratory study aims to determine the optimal specifications for the clinical instrument design, using controlled static and microfluidic flow experiments. Two of the main components of the LSCI instrument are the camera used for recording, and the laser used for coherent illumination of the tissue. Thus, a broad camera and laser comparison was performed spanning a wide array of available hardware options to determine which specifications are the most important for reliable and highly sensitive flow measurements. The two-phase clinical study aims to demonstrate the performance and utility of LSCI in a neurosurgical setting as a potential tool for real-time, continuous, and noninvasive image guidance. These studies demonstrate that LSCI can produce blood flow maps consistent with expected physiological trends, and show the impact of instrument design and image acquisition techniques on image quality and quantitative flow assessment. The results from both the laboratory and clinical studies can be used to design a more sensitive and robust LSCI system, which increases its value as an intraoperative tool for monitoring blood flow. LSCI has the potential to be the next generation of neurosurgical image guidance for blood flow visualization, and the work presented in this dissertation can accelerate its clinical adoption.}},

abstract = {{Knowledge about the optical properties µa , µs , and g of human blood plays an important role for many diagnostic and therapeutic applications in laser medicine and medical diagnostics. They strongly depend on physiological parameters such as oxygen saturation, osmolarity, flow conditions, haematocrit, etc. The integrating sphere technique and inverse Monte Carlo simulations were applied to measure µa , µs , and g of circulating human blood. At 633 nm the optical properties of human blood with a haematocrit of 10\% and an oxygen saturation of 98\% were found to be 0.210±0.002mm?1 for mµ, 77.3±0.5mm?1 for µs , and 0.994±0.001 for the g factor. An increase of the haematocrit up to 50\% lead to a linear increase of absorption and reduced scattering. Variations in osmolarity and wall shear rate led to changes of all three parameters while variations in the oxygen saturation only led to a significant change of the absorption coefficient. A spectrum of all three parameters was measured in the wavelength range 400–2500 nm for oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, showing that blood absorption followed the absorption behavior of haemoglobin and water. The scattering coefficient decreased for wavelengths above 500 nm with approximately ?-1.7; the g factor was higher than 0.9 over the whole wavelength range.}},

The authors show that LSF can image the spatiotemporal dynamics of CBF changes in mice through an intact skull. When measured by LSF, peak CBF increases during whisker stimulation closely correlated with simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements, and were greater within the branches of the middle cerebral artery supplying barrel cortex than within barrel cortex capillary bed itself. When LSF was used to study the response to inhaled CO2 (5\%), the flow increase was similar to the response reported using LDF. For the upper and lower limits of autoregulation, mean arterial pressure values were 110 and 40 mm Hg, respectively. They also show a linear relationship between absolute resting CBF, as determined by [14C]iodoamphetamine technique, and 1/τc values obtained using LSF, and used 1/τc values to compare resting CBF between different animals. Finally, the authors studied CBF changes after distal middle cerebral artery ligation, and developed a model to investigate the spatial distribution and hemodynamics of moderate to severely ischemic cortex. In summary, LSF has distinct advantages over LDF for CBF monitoring because of high spatial resolution.}},

We assume that the tissue matrix surrounding the blood cells is a strong diffuser of light and that moving erythrocytes, therefore, are illuminated by a spatially distributed source. Because the surrounding tissue is considered to be stationary, Doppler shifts in the frequency of the scattered light arise only from photon interactions with the moving blood cells. The theory implies that the time decay of the photon autocorrelation function scales proportionally with cell size and inversely with mean translational speed. Analysis of multiple interactions of photons with moving cells indicates the manner in which spectral measurements additionally are sensitive to changes in blood volume. Predictions are verified by measurements of particle flow in model tissues.}},

A method for high spatial and temporal resolution imaging of blood flow dynamics is required to provide objective evaluation of external stimuli, such as pharmacological intervention, electrical stimulation, or laser irradiation. Existing methods for blood flow imaging are inadequate. Laser Doppler imaging requires mechanical scanning, limiting spatial and temporal resolution (Forrester et al., 2002). Magnetic resonance imaging (Schauble and Cascino, 2003) is impractical for routine use and has very limited temporal resolution. Doppler optical coherence tomography Li et al., 2001, Rollins et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2003 and Zhao et al., 2000 can provide longitudinal cross sections of the microvasculature, but simultaneous high temporal resolution and lateral imaging of blood flow cannot be achieved. 
Laser speckle imaging (LSI) Briers, 2001, Dunn et al., 2001 and Forrester et al., 2002 is a technique in which time-integrated speckle patterns generated by low-power laser irradiation are imaged with a CCD camera. A simple, lowpass-filtering algorithm is used to convert raw speckle images to flow images. LSI has several advantages over existing methods, including simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution, ease of implementation, and relatively low cost. We now report the use of a LSI system that is capable of imaging blood flow dynamics in the in vivo rodent dorsal skin fold microvasculature.}},

By illuminating the cortex with laser light and imaging the resulting speckle pattern, relative CBF images with tens of microns spatial and millisecond temporal resolution are obtained. The regional CBF changes measured with the speckle technique are validated through direct comparison with conventional laser-Doppler measurements. Using this method, dynamic images of the relative CBF changes during focal cerebral ischemia and cortical spreading depression were obtained along with electrophysiologic recordings. Upon middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, the speckle technique yielded high-resolution images of the residual CBF gradient encompassing the ischemic core, penumbra, oligemic, and normally perfused tissues over a 6 × 4 mm cortical area. Successive speckle images demonstrated a further decrease in residual CBF indicating an expansion of the ischemic zone with finely delineated borders. Dynamic CBF images during cortical spreading depression revealed a 2 to 3 mm area of increased CBF (160\% to 250\%) that propagated with a velocity of 2 to 3 mm/min. This technique is easy to implement and can be used to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of CBF changes with high resolution in studies of cerebral pathophysiology.}},

In addition, the optical properties of two human tumours (meningioma, astrocytoma WHO grade II) were determined. Diffuse reflectance, total transmittance and collimated transmittance of the samples were measured using an integrating-sphere technique. From these experimental data, the absorption coefficients, the scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factors of the samples were determined employing an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The tissues investigated differed from each other predominantly in their scattering properties. Thermal coagulation reduced the optical penetration depth substantially. The highest penetration depths for all tissues investigated were found in the wavelength range between 1000 and 1100 nm. A comparison with data from the literature revealed the importance of the employed tissue preparation technique and the impact of the theoretical model used to extract the optical coefficients from the measured quantities.}},

Although techniques such as Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) have emerged as valuable tools for imaging CBF in acute experiments, their utility for chronic measurements or cross-animal comparisons has been limited. Recently, an extension to LSCI called Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging (MESI) was introduced that increases the quantitative accuracy of CBF images. In this paper, we show that estimates of chronic blood flow are better with MESI than with traditional LSCI. We evaluate the accuracy of the MESI flow estimates using red blood cell (RBC) photographic tracking as an absolute flow calibration in mice over several days. The flow measures computed using the MESI and LSCI techniques were found to be on average 10\% and 24\% deviant (n 1⁄4 9 mice), respectively, compared with RBC velocity changes. We also map CBF dynamics after photo-thrombosis of selected cortical microvasculature. Correlations of flow dynamics with RBC tracking were closer with MESI (r 1⁄4 0.88) than with LSCI (r 1⁄4 0.65) up to 2 weeks from baseline. With the increased quantitative accuracy, MESI can provide a platform for studying the efficacy of stroke therapies aimed at flow restoration.}},

Laser speckle is a random interference effect that gives a grainy appearance to objects illuminated by laser light. If the object consists of individual moving scatterers (such as blood cells), the speckle pattern fluctuates. These fluctuations provide information about the velocity distribution of the scatterers. It can be shown that the speckle and Doppler approaches are different ways of looking at the same phenomenon. Both these techniques measure at a single point. If a map of the velocity distribution is required, some form of scanning must be introduced. This has been done for both time-varying speckle and laser Doppler. However, with the speckle technique it is also possible to devise a full-field technique that gives an instantaneous map of velocities in real time. This review article presents the theory and practice of these techniques using a tutorial approach and compares the relative merits of the scanning and full-field approaches to velocity map imaging. The article concludes with a review of reported applications of these techniques to blood perfusion mapping and imaging.}},

CBF measurements are important for assessing whether blood flow has returned to presurgical baseline levels and for assessing postsurgical tissue viability. Existing techniques for intraoperative monitoring of CBF based on magnetic resonance imaging are expensive and often impractical, while techniques such as indocyanine green angiography cannot produce quantitative measures of blood flow. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical technique that has been widely used to quantitatively image relative CBF in animal models in vivo. In a pilot clinical study, we adapted an existing neurosurgical operating microscope to obtain LSCI images in humans in real time during neurosurgery under baseline conditions and after bipolar cautery. Simultaneously recorded ECG waveforms from the patient were used to develop a filter that helped reduce measurement variabilities due to motion artifacts. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of using LSCI to obtain blood flow images during neurosurgeries and its capability to produce full field CBF image maps with excellent spatial resolution in real-time with minimal disruption to the surgical procedure.}},
