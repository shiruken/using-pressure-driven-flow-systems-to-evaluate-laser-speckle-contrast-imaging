Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a non-invasive technique to determine the blood flow in superficial or exposed vasculature. However, the high scattering of biological tissue hinders the visualization of those structures. In this paper, we propose the use of principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with LSCI to improve the visualization of deep blood vessels by selecting the most significant principal components. This analysis was applied to in vitro samples, and our results demonstrate that this approach allows for the visualization and localization of blood vessels as deep as 1000 μm.}},

When measured by LSF, peak CBF increases during whisker stimulation closely correlated with simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements, and were greater within the branches of the middle cerebral artery supplying barrel cortex than within barrel cortex capillary bed itself. When LSF was used to study the response to inhaled CO2 (5\%), the flow increase was similar to the response reported using LDF. For the upper and lower limits of autoregulation, mean arterial pressure values were 110 and 40 mm Hg, respectively. They also show a linear relationship between absolute resting CBF, as determined by [14C]iodoamphetamine technique, and 1/τc values obtained using LSF, and used 1/τc values to compare resting CBF between different animals. Finally, the authors studied CBF changes after distal middle cerebral artery ligation, and developed a model to investigate the spatial distribution and hemodynamics of moderate to severely ischemic cortex. In summary, LSF has distinct advantages over LDF for CBF monitoring because of high spatial resolution.}},

The method is based on the visibility of the speckle pattern formed by the scattered light as detected by a single exposure of a digital camera. Whereas previous multispeckle methods rely on correlations between images, here the connection with scattering site dynamics is made more simply in terms of the variance of intensity among the pixels of the camera for the specified exposure duration. The essence is that the speckle pattern is more visible, i.e., the variance of detected intensity levels is greater, when the dynamics of the scattering site motion is slow compared to the exposure time of the camera. The theory for analyzing the moments of the spatial intensity distribution in terms of the electric-field autocorrelation is presented. It is tested for two well-understood samples, a colloidal suspension of Brownian particles and a coarsening foam, where the dynamics can be treated as stationary and hence can be benchmarked by traditional methods. However, our speckle-visibility method is particularly appropriate for samples in which the dynamics vary with time, either slowly or rapidly, limited only by the exposure time fidelity of the camera. Potential applications range from soft-glassy materials, to granular avalanches, to flowmetry of living tissue.}},

Following artery-targeted or traditional photothrombosis to the motor cortex of mice, post-ischemic cerebral blood flow was measured using multi-exposure speckle imaging at 6, 48, and 120 h post-occlusion. Artery-targeted photothrombosis produced a more graded penumbra at 48 and 120 h. The density of isolectin B4+ vessels in peri-infarct cortex was similarly increased after both types of infarcts compared to sham at 2 weeks. These results indicate that both models instigated post-ischemic vascular structural changes. Finally, we determined whether the strength of the traditional photothrombotic approach for modeling upper-extremity motor impairments extends to the artery-targeted approach. In adult mice that were proficient in a skilled reaching task, small motor-cortical infarcts impaired skilled-reaching performance for up to 10 days. These results support that artery-targeted photothrombosis widens the penumbra while maintaining the ability to create localized infarcts useful for modeling post-stroke impairments.}},

Using dynamic light scattering Monte Carlo simulations, the sensitivity of the autocorrelation function and speckle contrast to flow changes in the cerebral cortex was extensively examined. These simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity of the inverse autocorrelation time, 1/τc, varies across the field of view: directly over surface vessels 1/τc is strongly localized to the single vessel, while parenchymal ROIs have a larger sensitivity to flow changes at depths up to 500 μm into the tissue and up to 200 μm lateral to the ROI.

This fluidic instability results in a deteriorating performance and the suspension of their unique functions occasionally. In this study, a fluidic-LPF (low pass filter), which is composed of an ACU (air compliance unit) and a FCSP (fluidic channel with high fluidic resistance for sufficient preload), has been proposed for providing the stabilization of hydrodynamic flow in microfluidic devices. To investigate the characteristics of various fluidic networks including our fluidic-LPF, we used a parametric identification method to estimate the time constants via a transient response that was based on a discrete parameter model. In addition, we propose the use of a pulsation index (PI) to quantify the fluctuations in flow rate. We verified the formula for PI derived herein by varying individually both the periods and the air compliance volumes in the ACU, both theoretically and experimentally. We found that the PI depended strongly on either the time constants or the periods of the flow rates at the inlet. Additionally, the normalized differences between the experimental results and the theoretical estimations were less than 6\%, which shows that the proposed formula for PI can provide an accurate quantification of the fluctuations in flow, and estimate the parametric effects. Finally, we have successfully demonstrated that our fluidic-LPF can regulate fluctuations in the flow at extremely low flow rates ( 10 μL h−1) and can also control severe fluidic fluctuations (PI = 0.67) with excessively long periods (100 s) via a microfluidic viscometer. We therefore believe that the stabilization of hydrodynamic flow using a fluidic-LPF could be used easily and extensively with a range of microfluidic platforms that require constant flow rates.}},

Although techniques such as Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) have emerged as valuable tools for imaging CBF in acute experiments, their utility for chronic measurements or cross-animal comparisons has been limited. Recently, an extension to LSCI called Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging (MESI) was introduced that increases the quantitative accuracy of CBF images. In this paper, we show that estimates of chronic blood flow are better with MESI than with traditional LSCI. We evaluate the accuracy of the MESI flow estimates using red blood cell (RBC) photographic tracking as an absolute flow calibration in mice over several days. The flow measures computed using the MESI and LSCI techniques were found to be on average 10\% and 24\% deviant (n 1⁄4 9 mice), respectively, compared with RBC velocity changes. We also map CBF dynamics after photo-thrombosis of selected cortical microvasculature. Correlations of flow dynamics with RBC tracking were closer with MESI (r 1⁄4 0.88) than with LSCI (r 1⁄4 0.65) up to 2 weeks from baseline. With the increased quantitative accuracy, MESI can provide a platform for studying the efficacy of stroke therapies aimed at flow restoration.}},

We also quantify the fluctuations induced at different flow rates, using syringes of different diameters, and using different syringe pumps with different advancing distances per step. Our work provides a way to predict the frequency of the fluctuation that the driving syringe pump induces on a microfluidic system and suggests that syringe pumps can be a source of fluctuations in microfluidic flows, thus contributing to the polydispersity of the resulting droplets.}},

Aim: We aim to demonstrate the ability of LSCI to continuously visualize blood flow during neurovascular procedures. Approach: LSCI hardware was attached to the surgical microscope and did not interfere with the normal operation of the microscope. To more easily visualize CBF in real time, LSCI images were registered with the built-in microscope white light camera such that LSCI images were overlaid on the white light images and displayed to the neurosurgeon continuously in real time. Results: LSCI was performed throughout each surgery when the microscope was positioned over the patient, providing the surgeon with real-time visualization of blood flow changes before, during, and after aneurysm clipping or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) resection in humans. LSCI was also compared with indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) to assess CBF during aneurysm clipping and AVM surgery; integration of the LSCI hardware with the microscope enabled simultaneous acquisition of LSCI and ICGA. Conclusions: The results suggest that LSCI can provide continuous and real-time CBF visualization without affecting the surgeon workflow or requiring a contrast agent. The results also demonstrate that LSCI and ICGA provide different, yet complementary information about vessel perfusion.}},

Here, we show experimentally with in vivo real-time imaging that similar, spontaneous depolarizations cycle repeatedly around ischaemic lesions in the cerebral cortex, and enlarge the lesion in step with each cycle. This behaviour results in regular periodicity of depolarization when monitored at a single point in the lesion periphery. We present evidence from clinical monitoring to suggest that depolarizations may cycle in the ischaemic human brain, perhaps explaining progressive growth of infarction. Despite their apparent detrimental role in infarct growth, we argue that cycling of depolarizations around lesions might also initiate upregulation of the neurobiological responses involved in repair and remodelling.}},

CBF measurements are important for assessing whether blood flow has returned to presurgical baseline levels and for assessing postsurgical tissue viability. Existing techniques for intraoperative monitoring of CBF based on magnetic resonance imaging are expensive and often impractical, while techniques such as indocyanine green angiography cannot produce quantitative measures of blood flow. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical technique that has been widely used to quantitatively image relative CBF in animal models in vivo. In a pilot clinical study, we adapted an existing neurosurgical operating microscope to obtain LSCI images in humans in real time during neurosurgery under baseline conditions and after bipolar cautery. Simultaneously recorded ECG waveforms from the patient were used to develop a filter that helped reduce measurement variabilities due to motion artifacts. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of using LSCI to obtain blood flow images during neurosurgeries and its capability to produce full field CBF image maps with excellent spatial resolution in real-time with minimal disruption to the surgical procedure.}},

This clinical study (n = 8) recorded multiple exposure times from the same cortical tissue area spanning 0.5–20 ms, and evaluated images individually as single-exposure LSCI and jointly using the MESI model. This study demonstrated that the MESI estimates provided the broadest flow sensitivity for sampling the flow magnitude in the human brain, closely followed by the shorter exposure times. Conservation of flow analysis on vascular bifurcations was used to validate physiological accuracy, with highly conserved flow estimates (<10%) from both MESI and 1 ms LSCI (n = 14 branches).

At 633 nm the optical properties of human blood with a haematocrit of 10\% and an oxygen saturation of 98\% were found to be 0.210±0.002mm?1 for mµ, 77.3±0.5mm?1 for µs , and 0.994±0.001 for the g factor. An increase of the haematocrit up to 50\% lead to a linear increase of absorption and reduced scattering. Variations in osmolarity and wall shear rate led to changes of all three parameters while variations in the oxygen saturation only led to a significant change of the absorption coefficient. A spectrum of all three parameters was measured in the wavelength range 400–2500 nm for oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, showing that blood absorption followed the absorption behavior of haemoglobin and water. The scattering coefficient decreased for wavelengths above 500 nm with approximately ?-1.7; the g factor was higher than 0.9 over the whole wavelength range.}},

Data are expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), as a function of baseline and scaled to the thermal plateau. Reproducibility is expressed as within subject coefficients of variation (CV, in \%) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
              Results: Twenty-eight healthy participants were enrolled in this study. The reproducibility of the PORH peak CVC was better when assessed with LSCI compared to LDF (CV=8\%; ICC=0.76 and CV=30\%; ICC=0.54, respectively). Inter-day reproducibility of the LTH plateau was better when assessed with LSCI or LDI than LDF (CV=15\%, ICC=0.66; CV=17\%, ICC=0.51 and CV=42\%, ICC=0.28 respectively).

In this paper, we present imaging outcomes extending 35 days after photo-thrombotic occlusion, tracking the progression of the vasculature throughout this period. We compare MESI flow estimates within the unresolvable parenchyma with subsurface microvascular volume fractions taken with two-photon microscopy in the same regions to assess how the vascular density influences the surface-integrated MESI flow values. The MESI flow measurements and volume fractions are shown to have high correlations (r=0.90) within areas of recovering vasculature in the peri-infarct region. We also observe vascular reorientation occurring within the microvascular structure throughout the 35-day postocclusion period. With the combination of a chronic mouse model and relatively noninvasive optical imaging techniques, we present an imaging protocol for monitoring long-term vascular progression after photo-thrombotic occlusion with the potential to test the efficacy of rehabilitation and pharmacological therapies.}},

The majority of work examining the impact of anesthesia on cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been restricted to before and after measurements with limited spatial resolution.
              New method: We used multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI), an advanced form of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), to characterize the dynamics of isoflurane anesthesia induction on cerebral vasculature and blood flow in the mouse brain.
              Results: The large anatomical changes caused by isoflurane are depicted with wide-field imagery and video highlighting the induction of general anesthesia. Within minutes of exposure, both vessel diameter and blood flow increased drastically compared to the awake state and remained elevated for the duration of imaging. An examination of the dynamics of anesthesia induction reveals that blood flow increased faster in arteries than in veins or parenchyma regions.
              Comparison with existing methods: MESI offers robust hemodynamic measurements across large fields-of-view and high temporal resolutions sufficient for continuous visualization of cerebrovascular events featuring major changes in blood flow.
              Conclusion: The large alterations caused by isoflurane anesthesia to the cortical vasculature and CBF are readily characterized using MESI. These changes are unrepresentative of normal physiology and provide further evidence that neuroscience experiments would benefit from transitioning to un-anesthetized awake animal models.}},

  abstract = {{High‐speed camera investigation of rapidly moving red blood cells (RBCs) in the microvasculature has been limited by an inability to handle the vast volume of data. We have developed a novel method to analyze large numbers of RBC images captured by a high‐resolution, high‐speed camera fitted on a confocal fluorescence microscope, to determine the velocities of individual RBCs in capillaries in vivo. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐labeled RBCs flowing in the microvasculature of the cerebral cortex of urethane‐anesthetized Wistar rats were recorded through the skull window on video clips during specified periods at high frame rates (500 fps). Sequential frames of moving RBCs in the video clips for a specified period were analyzed offline with in‐house software (KEIO‐IS2). Images of RBCs acquired were numbered automatically in order of appearance and displayed in a two‐dimensional (2‐D) RBC tracking map. The velocities of individual RBCs were automatically computed based on the RBC displacement per frame multiplied by the frame rate (fps), and the results were displayed in a 2‐D velocity map and a 2‐D RBC number map. Single capillaries were identified by staining with FITC‐dextran. The mean capillary velocity of RBCs was evaluated as 2.05 ± 1.59 mm/second in video clips obtained at 500 fps. This method is considered to have wide potential applicability.}},

  abstract = {{Stroke causes remodeling of vasculature surrounding the infarct, but whether and how vascular remodeling contributes to recovery is unclear. We established an approach to monitor and compare changes in vascular structure and blood flow with high spatiotemporal precision after photothrombotic infarcts in motor cortex using longitudinal 2-photon and multi-exposure speckle imaging in mice of both sexes. A spatially-graded pattern of vascular structural remodeling in peri-infarct cortex unfolded over the first two weeks post-stroke, characterized by vessel loss and formation, and selective stabilization of a subset of new vessels. This vascular structural plasticity was coincident with transient activation of transcriptional programs relevant for vascular remodeling, reestablishment of peri-infarct blood flow, and large improvements in motor performance. Local vascular plasticity was strongly predictive of restoration of blood flow, which was in turn predictive of behavioral recovery. These findings reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of vascular remodeling after stroke and demonstrate that a window of heightened vascular plasticity is coupled to the reestablishment of blood flow and behavioral recovery. Our findings support that neovascularization contributes to behavioral recovery after stroke by restoring blood flow to peri-infarct regions. These findings may inform strategies for enhancing recovery from stroke and other types of brain injury.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAn improved understanding of neural repair could inform strategies for enhancing recovery from stroke and other types of brain injury. Stroke causes remodeling of vasculature surrounding the lesion, but whether and how the process of vascular remodeling contributes to recovery of behavioral function has been unclear. Here we used longitudinal in vivo imaging to track vascular structure and blood flow in residual peri-infarct cortex after ischemic stroke in mice. We found that stroke created a restricted period of heightened vascular plasticity that was associated with restoration of blood flow, which was in turn predictive of recovery of motor function. Therefore, our findings support that vascular remodeling facilitates behavioral recovery after stroke by restoring blood flow to peri-infarct cortex.}},

  abstract = {{Medical laser applications require knowledge about the optical properties of target tissue. In this study, the optical properties of selected native and coagulated human brain structures were determined in vitro in the spectral range between 360 and 1100 nm. The tissues investigated included white brain matter, grey brain matter, cerebellum and brainstem tissues (pons, thalamus). In addition, the optical properties of two human tumours (meningioma, astrocytoma WHO grade II) were determined. Diffuse reflectance, total transmittance and collimated transmittance of the samples were measured using an integrating-sphere technique. From these experimental data, the absorption coefficients, the scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factors of the samples were determined employing an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The tissues investigated differed from each other predominantly in their scattering properties. Thermal coagulation reduced the optical penetration depth substantially. The highest penetration depths for all tissues investigated were found in the wavelength range between 1000 and 1100 nm. A comparison with data from the literature revealed the importance of the employed tissue preparation technique and the impact of the theoretical model used to extract the optical coefficients from the measured quantities.}},

We demonstrate that the pressure fluctuations are induced by the flow-rate fluctuations coming from mechanical oscillations of the pump motor. Also, we provide a mathematical model of the effect of the frequency of the pump on the normalized amplitude of pressure fluctuations and introduce a dimensionless parameter incorporating pump frequency, channel geometry and mechanical properties that can be used to predict the performance of different microfluidic device configurations. The normalized amplitude of pressure fluctuations decreases as the frequency of the pump increases and the elasticity of the channel material decreases. The mathematical model is verified experimentally over a range of typical operating conditions and possible applications are discussed.}},

  abstract = {{The pressure‐driven device is designed and the flow rates of the microfluidic systems can be supplied by the pressure‐driven flows, which can significantly reduce the flow‐rate fluctuations coming from the pump source. For pressure‐driven flows, the flow rates of the fluids can be predicted by measuring the pressure drop along a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing. Especially, by varying the geometrical parameters of the PTFE tubing, the predicted flow rates of the fluids are compared with the experimental measurements, and the testing precision of the pressure‐driven flows can be obtained. Meanwhile, the dynamic characteristics of the open‐loop and closed‐loop control pressure‐driven device are comparatively studied. Particularly, a proportional and integral (PI) controller is integrated with the closed‐loop control pressure‐driven device, and the effects of the parameters of the PI controller on the dynamic characteristics of the pressure‐driven devices are mainly discussed. Most importantly, by improving the dynamic characteristics of the pressure‐driven devices, precise measurement and control of the pressure‐driven flows can be achieved for microfluidic systems.}},

We find that the flow rate of liquid delivered from a syringe pump equipped with a glass syringe responds faster to the changes in the conditions of flow than the same liquid delivered from a plastic syringe; and the rate of flow delivered from compressed air responds faster than that from a glass syringe. We discover that the rate of flow that is driven by a syringe pump and regulated by an integrated pneumatic valve responds even faster, but this flow-control method is characterized by large perturbations. We also examine the possible effects of these large perturbations on NIH 3T3 cells in microfluidic channels and find that they could cause the detachment of NIH 3T3 cells in the microchannels.}},
